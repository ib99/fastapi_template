generate_blog_titles = """I want you to act as a professional blog titles generator. 
Think of titles that are seo optimized and attention-grabbing at the same time,
and will encourage people to click and read the blog post.
They should also be creative and clever.
Try to come up with titles that are unexpected and surprising.
Do not use titles that are too generic,or titles that have been used too many times before. I want to generate 10 titles maximum.
My blog post is is about {topic}
                                 
IMPORTANT: The output should be json array of 10 titles without field names. just the titles! Make Sure the JSON is valid.
                                                  
Example Output:
[
    "Title 1",
